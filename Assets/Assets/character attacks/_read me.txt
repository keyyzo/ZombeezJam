--------------------------------------------
Naming convention for weapons - in order of weakest to most powerful.

This naming convention is used for all weapons related animations and static graphics,
including running animations, firing animations, bullets and icons.

1_1:  Pistol 1 (Police pistol)
1_2:  Pistol 2 (Glock)
1_3:  Pistol 3 (Magnum)
2_1:  Shotgun 1 (Sawn off)
2_2:  Shotgun 2 (Pump action)
2_3:  Shotgun 3 (Assault shotgun)
3_1:  Machine gun 1 (uzi)
3_2:  Machine gun 2 (AK47)
3_3:  Machine gun 3 (M60)


--------------------------------------------
Application of firing animations


The idea is that the firing animations can be laid over each player running animation OR over static player standing graphics.
Firing animations are generic and are correctly positioned to work for all characters.
